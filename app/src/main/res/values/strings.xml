    <string name="about_instructions">Before you start, this is not a game by itself.\n\nThis app is meant to be used with the Welcome To The Moon game to allow you to flip cards easily, save your game and save precious table space.\n\nYou must have access to the physical game in order to play, this just replaces the three stacks of number and action cards.\n\nAll mechanics, theme and gameplay of the game belong to the designers Alexis Allard &amp; Benoit Turpin.\n\nIf you don\'t already have the game, you can check it out at BoardGameGeek:\n</string>
